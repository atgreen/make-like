# make-like
> An opinionated application template builder for LIKE applications

`make-like` is an application template builder for LIKE (Lisp In Kubernetes +
Emacs) applications.

It will create the basic foundation for LIKE applications, including:
* Makefile support for
  * Running the application locally
  * Running the application as a container, managed by podman, allowing you to add additional services (postgres, etc) to the pod.
* Github Actions support for CI testing
* Smart caching of quicklisp contents in the case of container builds

The application code itself is minimal, but provides some useful foundation elements:
* Prometheus metrics support
* Support for TOML-style config.ini files for application configuration
* Git tag-based application version strings
* Sly/Slime support when run in podman-managed containers
* easy-route preconfigured with health-check and static image/js/css content routes

# Tutorial

Create a `likefile` with contents similar to this:

    (make-like:make-application
      :app-name "simple"
      :author "Anthony Green <green@moxielogic.com"

Run the `make-like` command:

    $ make-like likefile
    $ cd simple/
    $ find .
    .
    ./static
    ./static/js
    ./static/images
    ./static/css
    ./dist
    ./src
    ./src/package.lisp
    ./src/simple.lisp
    ./src/simple.asd
    ./README.md
    ./.gitignore
    ./.github
    ./.github/workflows
    ./.github/workflows/build.yml
    ./build
    ./build/Dockerfile.base
    ./build/Dockerfile
    ./test
    ./test/config.ini
    ./test/test.sh
    ./test/podman-start.sh
    ./test/test-pod.yml
    ./Makefile

The `make` targets look like this:

    $ make
    Supported targets:
     clean          - clean the source tree
     podman-start   - run in podman using test/test-pod.yml
     podman-stop    - stop the test pod
     run            - run locally

To run the application in a container, do this:

    $ make podman-start
    [ LOTS OF OUTPUT REDACTED ]
    Waiting for http://localhost:8080/health
    ===========================================================================

    Application: http://localhost:8080

    Prometheus : http://localhost:9101/metrics

    Use emacs to 'sly-connect' to localhost port 4005

    Run 'make podman-stop' to stop the test pod
